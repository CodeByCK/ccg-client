# Pet Site Demo

> [DEMO](https://blissful-bhabha-f5ad6e.netlify.com/)

> The site was custom built without any help from outside libraries.
 
> Technologies used: React and Sass. 

> During my search for an API, I began digging how Petland was retrieving its information. After going through all their network calls on the developer tools, I was able to hit the same endpoint with no problem allowing me to create the application without any need for my own backend. This allowed me to concentrate on building a visually appealing user interface. 

> If you have any questions regarding the code, feel free to reach out.

> Thanks, Chris
